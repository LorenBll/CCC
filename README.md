# CCC
CCC stands for *Cancel Cancel Culture*. This tool allows users to download single youtube videos and playlists, saving them locally to prevent their cancellation.

## Important Message
The last and current version of this tool is [CCC v1.0](https://github.com/LorenBll/CCC/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha). This version is the first release of the tool and it is still in alpha stage.
Despite saying that updates were sure to come, I have decided to suspend indefinetly the development of this tool due to lack of time and interest.
